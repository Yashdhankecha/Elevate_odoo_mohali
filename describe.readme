PROJECT OVERVIEW: ELEVATE
================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elevate is a comprehensive, full-stack Placement Management System designed to 
streamline the campus recruitment process. It serves as a centralized bridge 
connecting four key stakeholders: Students, Universities (via Training & 
Placement Officers - TPOs), Companies (Recruiters), and Platform Administrators 
(Super Admins).

The platform digitizes the entire lifecycle of placement—from student registration 
and profile verification to job postings, interview scheduling, and final 
offer rollouts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CORE ARCHITECTURE & TECHNOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js for a robust RESTful API.
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose) for flexible, schema-based data storage.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. USER ROLES & FUNCTIONALITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system is built around four distinct user roles, each with specific permissions 
and workflows.

### 3.1 SUPER ADMIN (Platform Owner)
The Super Admin has the highest level of control, overseeing the entire platform's 
integrity.
*   **Global Dashboard**: View real-time statistics on total registered colleges (TPOs), 
    companies, and students across the platform.
*   **TPO & Company Validation**: Review and approve platform access for new 
    Training & Placement Officers and Companies. This ensures only legitimate 
    entities enter the ecosystem.
*   **User Management**: Ability to block/unblock users who violate terms.

### 3.2 TRAINING & PLACEMENT OFFICER (TPO) (Institute Admin)
The TPO is the administrator for a specific college or institute. They manage their 
students and coordinate with companies.
*   **Institute Dashboard**: High-level view of placement stats, unplaced students, 
    and upcoming drives for their specific college.
*   **Student Verification**:
    -   Validate student profiles (academic records, skills).
    -   Approve students for placement eligibility.
*   **Job Management**:
    -   Review job postings created by companies before they become visible to students.
    -   Ensure job offers meet college standards (CTC, role).
*   **Drive Management**: Coordinate interview dates and campus visits.
*   **Reports**: Generate branch-wise placement reports (Verified vs Unverified, Placed vs Unplaced).

### 3.3 COMPANY (Recruiter)
External organizations looking to hire talent.
*   **Company Profile**: detailed branding page with logo, description, and industry info.
*   **Job Posting Workflow**:
    -   Create comprehensive Job Descriptions (JD) including role, package (CTC), 
        eligibility criteria (min CGPA, branches), and locations.
    -   Manage job status (Active, Closed, Draft).
*   **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**:
    -   View all applicants for a specific specific job.
    -   Filter candidates based on skills or grades.
    -   Update candidate status: *Applied -> Shortlisted -> Interview Scheduled -> Selected -> Rejected*.
*   **Interview Scheduling**: Propose interview slots to TPOs.

### 3.4 STUDENT (Job Seeker)
The end-user focusing on career development and job hunting.
*   **Smart Registration**:
    -   Students *must* select a valid college with an active TPO during signup.
    -   Real-time search validates the college against the TPO database.
*   **Profile Builder**:
    -   Detailed inputs for Academics (CGPA, Backlogs), Skills, Projects, and Internships.
    -   Profile "completeness" tracker.
*   **Job Portal**:
    -   View eligible job openings approved by their TPO.
    -   One-click "Apply" functionality.
    -   Track application status in real-time.
*   **Skill Development**:

4. KEY PROCESS FLOWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1 REGISTRATION & ONBOARDING FLOW
1.  **TPO Registration**: A new TPO registers an institute.
2.  **Super Admin Approval**: Super Admin verifies and activates the TPO account.
3.  **Student Registration**: Students sign up. **CRITICAL**: They search for and select 
    their college from the list of active TPOs. This links the student strictly to 
    their specific institute.
4.  **Company Registration**: Companies sign up and await Super Admin/TPO approval 
    to start posting jobs.

### 4.2 PLACEMENT DRIVE FLOW
1.  **Job Creation**: Company creates a Job Posting (e.g., "Software Engineer, 12 LPA").
2.  **TPO Review**: The TPO of the target college sees the job request. They review 
    and "Approve" it.
3.  **Student Notification**: Eligible students in that college get alerted.
4.  **Application**: Students apply. TPO may filter/shortlist initially.
5.  **Shortlisting**: Company reviews applicants and updates status to "Shortlisted".
6.  **Interviews**: Interviews are conducted (offline/online).
7.  **Offer**: Company updates status to "Selected".
8.  **Placement**: Student is marked as "Placed" in the system, removing them from 
    future lower-tier drives (optional rule).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Validation**: Rigorous checks ensure students belong to valid colleges.
*   **Protection**: Passwords hashed with Bcrypt. API endpoints protected via JWT.
*   **Data Isolation**: TPOs can only see data relevant to their own institute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SUMMARY

Elevate is an ecosystem that creates accountability and transparency. 
It replaces manual spreadsheets with a live, interactive database, ensuring that 
Super Admins oversee the platform, TPOs control their quality, Companies find
